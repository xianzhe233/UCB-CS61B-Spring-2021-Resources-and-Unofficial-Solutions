# UCB CS61B Spring 2021 Resources & Unofficial Solutions

## Overview
- **Full Points Achieved:** All assignments scored full points, except for Lab 8, where **my implementation passed all Gradescope tests, including Extra Credit**, except due to persistent API errors, possibly stemming from compatibility issues with the original code.
- **Extra Credit:** All extra credit points have been obtained.

## Annotations
- **Comments for Clarity:** My code is nearly fully annotated with appropriate comments to enhance readability, providing clarity on the logic and methods used, especially in complex or confusing sections.
- **Code Structure:** I believe my code structure is reasonably well-organized. I've tried my best to reduce the complexity, but maybe you have better ideas.
